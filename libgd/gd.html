<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is gd?</H3></A>
<P>
gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly
draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple
colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and
write out the result as a .GIF file. This is particularly
useful in World Wide Web applications, where .GIF is the
format used for inline images.
<P>
gd is not a paint program. 
If you are looking for a paint program, try xpaint by David 
Koblas, available by <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ko/koblas">
anonymous FTP</A> from ftp.netcom.com in pub/ko/koblas.
(That package is for the X Window System; for the Mac and the PC, paint
programs are considerably easier to find.)
<P>
gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics
operation. It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become
a kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 1.2 incorporates
most of the commonly requested features for a 2D package.
Font support does need improvement, and support for the PNG
graphics format will arrive in a forthcoming release.
<P>
<A NAME="gdperl"><H3>What if I want to use Perl instead of C?</H3></A>
gd can also be used from Perl, courtesy of
Lincoln Stein's
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html">
GD.pm</a> library, which uses gd as the basis for a set of
Perl 5.x classes. GD.pm is based on gd 1.1.1 but gd 1.2 should
be compatible.
<A NAME="gdtcl"><H3>What if I want to use Tcl instead of C?</H3></A>
gd can also be used from Tcl by way of the
<a href="http://guraldi.hgp.med.umich.edu/gdtcl.html">gdtcl</a>
Tcl extension.
<A NAME="gdit"><H3>What if I want to use another scripting language?</H3></A>
There are, at the moment, at least three simple interpreters that
perform gd operations. You can output the desired commands to a simple
text file from whatever scripting language you prefer to use, then
invoke the interpreter.
<p>
These packages are based on gd 1.1.1 as of this writing but should
be compatible with gd 1.2 with minimal tweaking.

</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.2?</H3></A>
Version 1.2 is another fine-tuning release. The next major release
will after 1.2 will be version 2.0 and will feature support for
the new <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/png.html">PNG</a>
graphics format as well as improved font support. gd 1.2 does
add several new fonts in the meantime.
<p>
Version 1.2 moves gd to ANSI standard C. Non-ANSI C compilers,
such as the old SunOS 4.1.3 cc compiler, will not work. The use
of pre-ANSI C led to several long-standing bugs, and the ANSI C 
standard has been with us for nearly ten years now. If your compiler 
does not support ANSI, upgrade to a recent release of your compiler, 
or get gcc, which is free and does support ANSI C. 
<P>
The provided Unix Makefile has been changed to be a bit
more broadly compatible, and to acknowledge the changes that
may be necessary on various systems.
<P>
Version 1.2 also includes the following improvements:
<P>
<ul>
<li><a href="#gdImageCopy">gdImageCopy</a> and
<a href="#gdImageCopyResized">gdImageCopyResized</a> now ignore
pixels which are transparent in the source image. This is allows
easy copying of non-square regions, which could previously be
accomplished only with brushes.
<li><a href="#gdImageFilledPolygon">gdImageFilledPolygon</a>
now draws horizontal edges correctly, correcting a
long-standing bug. In addition, gdImageFilledPolygon copes
with polygons which have several horizontal segments on
the same scan line. There can still be a few pixels of
disagreement between gdImagePolygon and gdImageFilledPolygon
with regard to the borders of the polygon, however.
<li>Several new public-domain fonts are included, courtesy of
Joseph M. Orost at AT&T.
<li>gd now properly recognizes an existing image with a
high color slot number transparent.
<li>Bugs in the <a href="#gdImageCreateFromXbm">gdImageCreateFromXbm</a>
function have been corrected. Previously the function was incorrect
for image widths not evenly divisible by eight.
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="whatsnew1.1.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.1.1?</H3></A>
A fine-tuning and bug-fixing release.
<P>
<A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A> now copies
the style array to make it easier to take advantage of
the line styling feature; it is now safe to free the memory
associated with your style array after setting a style
(or allocate styles on the stack...).  This should not break 
existing code.
<P>
<A HREF="#webgif">webgif</A>, a small but powerful GIF-manipulating 
utility program, has been added as an additional code example.
<P>
An access macro to determine
whether an image is interlaced has been added; see
<A HREF="gdImageGetInterlaced">gdImageGetInterlaced</A>.
<P>
A better Unix Makefile, provided by Mark Scott. Note that
an actual library (libgd.a) is now produced; you will want
to link with this library in your own gd apps, in the same
manner that gddemo and giftogd link with it. You no longer
need to explicitly list the standard font files on the link 
line. No doubt many users have already made this enhancement 
themselves.
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> depending on your system you may
need to rewrite this Makefile. Basic code-compiling skills
are expected for the use of this library.
<P>
<A HREF="#koblas">David Koblas</A> has been given proper credit
for the original GIF decoding routine; previously I erroneously
credited David Rowley with both the encoder and the decoder.
<P>
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A> no longer crashes when
attempting to fill a region with the color it already has.
Also, attempting to fill a region with the special color
<A HREF="#gdTiled">gdTiled</A> no longer crashes. 
<P>
However, filling a region with a transparent tile has been
forbidden (gdImageFill simply draws nothing in this case).
Otherwise, gd would not know when to stop drawing
without the use of an additional image to keep track of
which pixels have been visited. 
<P>
Invoking <A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">gdImageFillToBorder</A>
with a special border color such as <A HREF="#gdTiled">gdTiled</A>
now fails, for similar reasons. However, the color
you are filling <em>with</em> can be <A HREF="#gdTiled">gdTiled</A>,
even if it is transparent. See the discussion of
<A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">gdImageFillToBorder</A> for
additional caveats.
<P>
Many documentation fixes.

<A NAME="required"><H3>What else do I need to use gd?</H3></A>
<P>
To use gd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. Any full-ANSI-standard
C compiler should be adequate, although those with PCs will need to replace
the Makefile with one of their own. <strong>The cc compiler released
with SunOS 4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler. Get gcc, which is freely
available. See the Sun-related newsgroups for more information.</strong>
<P>
You will also want a GIF viewer, if you do not already have
one for your system, since you will need a good way to check the
results of your work. lview is a good package for 
Windows PCs; xv is a good package for X11. There are
GIF viewers available for every graphics-capable
computer out there, so consult newsgroups relevant to
your particular system.
<P>
<A NAME="getgd"><H3>How do I get gd?</H3></A>
<P>
You can 
<A HREF="ftp://isis.cshl.org/pub/gd/gd1.2.tar.Z">
fetch gd as a compressed tar file</A>, Or you can FTP it directly from 
isis.cshl.org, in the subdirectory pub/gd.
<A NAME="buildgd"><H3>How do I build gd?</H3></A>
<P>
In order to build gd, first uncompress and untar the gd.tar file with the
following commands:
<P>
<em>Note:</em> if you have a non-Unix system, you will need
to acquire versions of "uncompress" and "tar" suitable for
your system. Both have been ported to PC and Mac
environments. Consult newsgroups relevant to your
particular system.
<PRE>
uncompress gd1.2.tar.Z
tar -xf gd1.2.tar
</PRE>
This will create the directory "gd1.2" beneath the current
directory.
<P>
cd to this directory and examine the Makefile, which you may need
to change slightly depending on your installation (or more than
slightly for a Windows or Mac environment).
<P>
Now, to build the demonstration program, just type "make gddemo"
if you are working in a command-line environment. If all goes well,
the program "gddemo" will be compiled and linked without incident.
Depending on your system you may need to edit the Makefile.
Understanding the basic techniques of compiling and linking
programs on your system is up to you.
<P>
You have now built a demonstration program which shows off
the capabilities of gd. To see it in action, type
"gddemo".
<P>
gddemo should execute without incident, creating the file
demoout.gif. (Note there is also a file named demoin.gif,
which is provided in the package as part of the demonstration.)
<P>
Display demoout.gif in your GIF viewer. The image should
be 128x128 pixels and should contain an image of the
space shuttle with the word "hi" written in the upper
left corner twice (once across and once upwards),
an arc in the middle and an oval intersecting the arc
(these are somewhat faint).
<p>
In addition, a diagonal line made up of tiny space shuttle
images should appear from the lower left to the upper
right corner.   A blue frame with green interior trim should 
surround the picture.
<P>
(If you are missing the demoin.gif file, the other items
should appear anyway.)
<P>
Look at demoin.gif to see the original space shuttle
image which was scaled and copied into the output image.
<P>
<A NAME="basics"><H3>gd basics: using gd in your program</H3></A>
gd lets you create GIF images on the fly. To use gd in your
program, include the file gd.h, and link with the libgd.a
library produced by "make libgd.a", under Unix. You will
need to adapt the makefile for your needs if you are using
a non-Unix operating system, but this is very straightforward.
<P>
If you want to use the provided fonts, include
gdfontt.h, gdfonts.h, gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. If you 
are not using the provided Makefile and/or a library-based approach, be
sure to include the source modules as well in your
project. (They may be too large for 16-bit memory models,
that is, 16-bit DOS and Windows.)
<P>
Here is a short example program. <strong>(For a more advanced example,
see gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same program; 
it demonstrates additional features!)</strong>
<P>
<PRE>
/* Bring in gd library functions */
#include "gd.h"

/* Bring in standard I/O so we can output the GIF to a file */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
	/* Declare the image */
	<A HREF="#gdImagePtr">gdImagePtr</A> im;
	/* Declare an output file */
	FILE *out;
	/* Declare color indexes */
	int black;
	int white;

	/* Allocate the image: 64 pixels across by 64 pixels tall */
	im = <A HREF="#gdImageCreate">gdImageCreate</A>(64, 64);

	/* Allocate the color black (red, green and blue all minimum).
		Since this is the first color in a new image, it will
		be the background color. */
	black = <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>(im, 0, 0, 0);	

	/* Allocate the color white (red, green and blue all maximum). */
	white = <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>(im, 255, 255, 255);	
	
	/* Draw a line from the upper left to the lower right,
		using white color index. */
	<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>(im, 0, 0, 63, 63, white);	

	/* Open a file for writing. "wb" means "write binary", important
		under MSDOS, harmless under Unix. */
	out = fopen("test.gif", "wb");

	/* Output the image to the disk file. */
	<A HREF="#gdImageGif">gdImageGif</A>(im, out);	

	/* Close the file. */
	fclose(out);

	/* Destroy the image in memory. */
	<A HREF="#gdImageDestroy">gdImageDestroy</A>(im);
}
</PRE>
When executed, this program creates an image, allocates
two colors (the first color allocated becomes the background
color), draws a diagonal line (note that 0, 0 is the upper
left corner), writes the image to a GIF file, and
destroys the image.
<P>
The above example program should
give you an idea of how the package works.
gd provides many additional functions, which are listed
in the following reference chapters, complete with code
snippets demonstrating each. There is also an
<A HREF="#index">alphabetical index</A>. 
<H3><A NAME="webgif">Webgif: a more powerful gd example</A></H3>
Webgif is a simple utility program to manipulate GIFs from the
command line. It is written for Unix and similar command-line
systems, but should be easily adapted for other environments. 
Webgif allows you to set transparency and interlacing and
output interesting information about the GIF in question.
<P>
webgif.c is provided in the distribution. Unix users can
simply type "make webgif" to compile the program. Type
"webgif" with no arguments to see the available options.

If the brush image does not have the same color map as the
first image, any colors missing from the first image
will be allocated. If not enough colors can be allocated,
the closest colors already available will be used. This
allows arbitrary GIFs to be used as brush images. It also
means, however, that you should not set a brush unless you
will actually use it; if you set a rapid succession of
different brush images, you can quickly fill your color map,
and the results will not be optimal.
<P>
You need not take any special action when you are finished
with a brush. As for any other image, if you will not
be using the brush image for any further purpose,
you should call <A HREF="#gdImageDestroy">gdImageDestroy</A>.
You must not use the color <A HREF="#gdBrushed">gdBrushed</A>
if the current brush has been destroyed; you can of
course set a new brush to replace it.

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG> 
<DD>
It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and other
variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used to set
any desired series of colors, including a special color that
leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the drawing
of a line. 
<P>
To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign
them the desired series of color values to be repeated. 
You can assign the special color value <A HREF="#gdTransparent">
gdTransparent</A> to indicate that the existing color should
be left unchanged for that particular pixel (allowing a dashed
line to be attractively drawn over an existing image). 
<P>
Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal
<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function with the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>.
<P>
As of <A HREF="#whatsnew1.1.1">version 1.1.1</A>, the style
array is copied when you set the style, so you need not
be concerned with keeping the array around indefinitely.
This should not break existing code that assumes styles
are not copied.
<P>
You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush
image at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke. 
When creating a style for use with a brush, the
style values are interpreted differently: zero (0) indicates
pixels at which the brush should not be drawn, while one (1) 
indicates pixels at which the brush should be drawn. 
To draw a styled, brushed line, you must use the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">
gdStyledBrushed</A>. For an example of this feature
in use, see gddemo.c (provided in the distribution).

current transparent color index in the image.
If there is no transparent color, gdImageGetTransparent
returns -1. Use this macro to obtain this information; do not 
access the structure directly.

<DD>
gdImageColorDeallocate marks the specified color as being
available for reuse. It does not attempt to determine whether
the color index is still in use in the image. After a call
to this function, the next call to 
<A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>
for the same image will set new RGB values for that
color index, changing the color of any pixels which 
have that index as a result. If multiple calls to
gdImageColorDeallocate are made consecutively, the lowest-numbered
index among them will be reused by the next 
<A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate"> gdImageColorAllocate</A> call.

gdImageColorTransparent sets the transparent color index
for the specified image to the specified index. To indicate
that there should be <em>no</em> transparent color, invoke
gdImageColorTransparent with a color index of -1.
<P>
The color index used should be an index
allocated by <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>,
whether explicitly invoked by your code or implicitly
invoked by loading an image.
In order to ensure that your image has a reasonable appearance
when viewed by users who do not have transparent background
capabilities, be sure to give reasonable RGB values to the
color you allocate for use as a transparent color,
<em>even though it will be transparent on systems
that support transparency</em>.

gdImageCopy is used to copy a rectangular portion of one image to
another image. (For a way of stretching or shrinking the image
in the process, see <A HREF="#gdImageCopyResized">
gdImageCopyResized</A>.)
<P>
The <code>dst</code> argument is the destination image to which the
region will be copied. The <code>src</code> argument is the source
image from which the region is copied. The <code>dstX</code>
and <code>dstY</code> arguments specify the point in the destination
image to which the region will be copied. The <code>srcX</code>
and <code>srcY</code> arguments specify the upper left corner
of the region in the source image. The <code>w</code>
and <code>h</code> arguments specify the width and height
of the region.
<P>
When you copy a region from one location in an image to another
location in the same image, gdImageCopy will perform as expected
unless the regions overlap, in which case the result is
unpredictable.
<P>
<strong>Important note on copying between images:</strong> since 
different images do 
not necessarily have the same color tables, pixels are not simply set to the

<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG> 
<DD>
gdImageCopyResized is used to copy a rectangular portion of one image to
another image. The X and Y dimensions of the original region and the
destination region can vary, resulting in stretching or shrinking of
the region as appropriate. (For a simpler version of this function
which does not deal with resizing, see <A HREF="#gdImageCopy">
gdImageCopy</A>.)
<P>
The <code>dst</code> argument is the destination image to which the
region will be copied. The <code>src</code> argument is the source
image from which the region is copied. The <code>dstX</code>
and <code>dstY</code> arguments specify the point in the destination
image to which the region will be copied. The <code>srcX</code>
and <code>srcY</code> arguments specify the upper left corner
of the region in the source image. The <code>dstW</code>
and <code>dstH</code> arguments specify the width and height
of the destination region. The <code>srcW</code>
and <code>srcH</code> arguments specify the width and height
of the source region and can differ from the destination size,
allowing a region to be scaled during the copying process.
<P>
When you copy a region from one location in an image to another

gdImageInterlace is used to determine whether an image should be stored
in a linear fashion, in which lines will appear on the display from
first to last, or in an interlaced fashion, in which the image
will "fade in" over several passes. By default, images are not
interlaced. 
<P>
A nonzero value for the interlace argument turns on interlace;
a zero value turns it off. Note that interlace has no effect
on other functions, and has no meaning unless you save the
image in GIF format; the gd and xbm formats do not support
interlace. 
<P>
When a GIF is loaded with <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGif">gdImageCreateFromGif
</A>, interlace will be set according to the setting in the GIF file.
<P>
Note that many GIF viewers and web browsers do <em>not</em> support
interlace. However, the interlaced GIF should still display; it
will simply appear all at once, just as other images do.

<H3><A NAME="constants">Constants</A></H3>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="gdBrushed">gdBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn in place of each pixel of the line (the brush is
usually larger than one pixel, creating the effect
of a wide paintbrush). See also
<A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> for a way
to draw broken lines with a series of distinct copies of an image.
<DT><A NAME="gdMaxColors"><code>gdMaxColors</code><strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The constant 256. This is the maximum number of colors in a GIF file
according to the GIF standard, and is also the maximum number of
colors in a gd image.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyled">gdStyled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyled is used as the color, the colors of the pixels are
drawn successively from the style that has been
set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>.
If the color of a pixel is equal to 
<A HREF="#gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A>, that pixel
is not altered. (This mechanism is completely unrelated
to the "transparent color" of the image itself; see
<A HREF="#gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>
gdImageColorTransparent for that mechanism.) See also 
<A NAME="#gdStyledBrushed"> gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyledBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn at each pixel of the line, providing that the
style set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>
contains a nonzero value (OR gdTransparent, which
does not equal zero but is supported for consistency) 
for the current pixel. (Pixels are drawn successively from the style as the
line is drawn, returning to the beginning when the
available pixels in the style are exhausted.) Note that
this differs from the behavior of <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>,
in which the values in the style are used as actual
pixel colors, except for gdTransparent.
<DT><A NAME="gdDashSize">gdDashSize</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The length of a dash in a dashed line. Defined to be 4 for
backwards compatibility with programs that use
<A NAME="gdImageDashedLine">gdImageDashedLine</A>. New
programs should use <A NAME="gdImageSetStyle">
gdImageSetStyle</A> and call the standard
<A NAME="gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function
with the special "color" <A NAME="gdStyled">
gdStyled</A> or <A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdTiled">gdTiled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in <A HREF="#gdImageFilledRectangle">
gdImageFilledRectangle</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageFilledPolygon">
gdImageFilledPolygon</A>,
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A>, and <A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">
gdImageFillToBorder</A>. gdTiled selects a pixel from the
tile image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetTile">gdImageSetTile</A>
in such a way as to ensure that the filled area will be
tiled with copies of the tile image. See the discussions of
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A> and
<A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">gdImageFillToBorder</A> for special
restrictions regarding those functions.
<DT><A NAME="gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in a style to be set with
<A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>. 
gdTransparent is <strong>not</strong> the transparent
color index of the image; for that functionality please
see <A HREF="gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>.

<A NAME="gdformat"><H3>About the additional .gd image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the GIF format and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is not a compressed format. Its purpose is solely to 
allow very fast loading of images your program needs often in
order to build other images for output. If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed GIF images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd">
gdImageCreateFromGd</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd">gdImageGd</A>,
which read and write .gd format images.
<P>
The program "giftogd.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.gif files to .gd format. I emphasize again that you will not
need to use this format unless you have a need for high-speed loading
of a few frequently-used images in your program.
<A NAME="informing"><H3>Please tell us you're using gd!</H3>
