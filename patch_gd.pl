+--------------------------
+
+Broke gd.c into multiple files; gd.c now has graphics operations, and gd_<zzz> has specific
+support for different formats (eg. GD, GD2, GIF).
+
+Restructured I/O so that reading from files/streams/anything is now possible. All handled
+through the IOCtx record which must define some basic I/O services. All services are defined
+for files, but only some are defined for in-memory pointers. The in-memory pointer 
+implementation is primarily for Perl compatibility. Changed basically involved writing some 
+low level IO routines, and relpacing most FILE* variables with IOCtx*.
+
+Added gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr, gdImageGifPtr, gdImageLzwPtr for Perl compatibility.
+
+Broke up the GIF handling routines; gd_gif_in.c does all GIF input (this did not change when
+support for LZW compression was removed). gd_gif_out.c not handles the miGif compression that
+was introduced in version 1.3
+
+Reinstated LZW support through the gdImageLzw function (defined in gd_lzw_out.c). 
+This is NOT built by default, and the header file must be modified to include it in the build.
+
+Added 'GD2' support. This is a zlib-compressed internal format useful for extracting portions
+of images without having to read entire image files. Informal tests suggest it is only 30% slower
+than the old GD format, and file space requirements are similar to GOF. The GD2 header fields 
+now contain version information, so the format can probably be considered stable across versions.
+
+Various other functions also added (see index.html).

+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
+`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
+reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
+(useful mainly for debugging `configure').
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
+contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
+called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
+it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
+
+The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
+     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
+     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
+     `configure' itself.
+
+     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
+     messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.
+
+  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   This package has three optional features which can be enabled at
+configure time:
+
+   ./configure --enable-jpeg           Enable JPEG support
+   ./configure --enable-freetype       Enable TrueType fonts
+   ./configure --enable-xpm            Enable reading of XPM files
+
+   You may combine these three features if you wish.
+
+JPEG and FreeType are only available if you have downloaded and
+installed the corresponding libraries.  Xpm is only available if you
+have the XPM library installed and have a full X11 installation.  If
+you try to install a feature, and don't have the appropriate library,
+you will receive a warning to that effect.
+
+Read README for information on obtaining these libraries.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
+initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
+a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
+this:
+     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
+
+Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
+     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
+supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
+
+   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
+variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
+in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
+one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
+architecture.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
+`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
+installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
+option `--prefix=PATH'.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
+PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
+will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
+`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the host type.
+
+   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
+use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
+produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
+system on which you are compiling the package.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Operation Controls
+==================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
+     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
+     debugging `configure'.
+
+`--help'
+     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--version'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

+--------------------------
+
+Broke gd.c into multiple files; gd.c now has graphics operations, and gd_<zzz> has specific
+support for different formats (eg. GD, GD2, GIF).
+
+Restructured I/O so that reading from files/streams/anything is now possible. All handled
+through the IOCtx record which must define some basic I/O services. All services are defined
+for files, but only some are defined for in-memory pointers. The in-memory pointer 
+implementation is primarily for Perl compatibility. Changed basically involved writing some 
+low level IO routines, and relpacing most FILE* variables with IOCtx*.
+
+Added gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr, gdImageGifPtr, gdImageLzwPtr for Perl compatibility.
+
+Broke up the GIF handling routines; gd_gif_in.c does all GIF input (this did not change when
+support for LZW compression was removed). gd_gif_out.c not handles the miGif compression that
+was introduced in version 1.3
+
+Reinstated LZW support through the gdImageLzw function (defined in gd_lzw_out.c). 
+This is NOT built by default, and the header file must be modified to include it in the build.
+
+Added 'GD2' support. This is a zlib-compressed internal format useful for extracting portions
+of images without having to read entire image files. Informal tests suggest it is only 30% slower
+than the old GD format, and file space requirements are similar to GOF. The GD2 header fields 
+now contain version information, so the format can probably be considered stable across versions.
+
+Various other functions also added (see index.html).

+GD 1.8.4_patch
+
+This is a patched version of Tom Boutell's GD library version 1.8.4.
+It uses the GNU Autoconfig system to make it easier to compile libgd
+as a shared library, as well as to locate the correct link libraries.
+Compiling libgd as a shared library will make it easier to run the
+Perl GD interface in some cases.
+
+Please see INSTALL and readme.txt for full instructions.
+
+Installation Synopsis
+---------------------
+
+ % ./configure --enable-jpeg --enable-freetype --enable-xpm
+ % make
+ % make install
+
+You may use the --x-includes option to tell configure about any .h files
+that may be installed in funny places, such as freetype.h
+
+Questions relating to the Perl GD module and to the functioning of
+this patch should be directed to Lincoln Stein (lstein@cshl.org).  All
+other questions relating to libgd should be directed to Tom Boutell
+(boutell@boutell.com).

-A graphics library for fast image creation
-
-Follow this link to the latest version of this document.
-
-     _HEY! READ THIS!_ gd 1.8.4 creates PNG, JPEG and WBMP images, not
-     GIF images. This is a good thing. PNG is a more compact format, and
-     full compression is available. JPEG works well with photographic
-     images, and is still more compatible with the major Web browsers
-     than even PNG is. WBMP is intended for wireless devices (not
-     regular web browsers). Existing code will need modification to call
-     gdImagePng or gdImageJpeg instead of gdImageGif. _Please do not ask
-     us to send you the old GIF version of GD._ Unisys holds a patent on
-     the LZW compression algorithm, which is used in fully compressed
-     GIF images. The best solution is to move to legally unencumbered,
-     well-compressed, modern image formats such as PNG and JPEG as soon
-     as possible.
-     
-     gd 1.8.4 _requires_ that the following libraries also be installed:
-     
-     libpng (see the libpng home page)
-     
-     zlib (see the info-zip home page) zlib
-     
-     jpeg-6b or later, if desired (see the Independent JPEG Group home
-     page)
-     
-     If you want to use the TrueType font support, you must also install
-     the _FreeType 2.x library_, including the header files. See the
-     Freetype Home Page, or SourceForge. No, I cannot explain why that
-     site is down on a particular day, and no, I can't send you a copy.
-     
-     If you want to use the Xpm color bitmap loading support, you must
-     also have the X Window System and the Xpm library installed (Xpm is
-     often included in modern X distributions).
-     
-     Please read the documentation and install the required libraries.
-     Do not send email asking why png.h is not found. See the
-     requirements section for more information. Thank you!

-
-  What is gd?
-  
-   gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
-   complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
-   other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
-   JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
-   where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
-   by most browsers.
-   
-   gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you
-   are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are
-   looking in the wrong place.
-   
-   gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation.
-   It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink
-   graphics package, but version 1.7.3 incorporates most of the commonly
-   requested features for an 8-bit 2D package. Support for truecolor
-   images, including truecolor JPEG and PNG, is planned for version 2.0.
-   
-  What if I want to use another programming language?
-  
-    Perl
-    
-   gd can also be used from Perl, courtesy of Lincoln Stein's GD.pm
-   library, which uses gd as the basis for a set of Perl 5.x classes.
-   Highly recommended.
-   
-    Tcl
-    
-   gd can be used from Tcl with John Ellson's Gdtclft dynamically loaded
-   extension package. (Gdtclft2.0 or later is needed for gd-1.6 and up
-   with PNG output.)
-   
-    Pascal
-    
-   Pascal enthusiasts should look into Michael Bradbury's gdfp package.
-   
-    Haskell
-    
-   A new gd interface is now available for Haskell programmers.
-   
-    REXX
-    
-   A gd interface for the REXX language is available.
-   
-    Any Language
-    
-   There are, at the moment, at least three simple interpreters that
-   perform gd operations. You can output the desired commands to a simple
-   text file from whatever scripting language you prefer to use, then
-   invoke the interpreter.

-     * fly, by Martin Gleeson
-       
-  What's new in version 1.8.4?
-  
-     * Add support for FreeType2 (John Ellson ellson@lucent.com)
-     * Add support for finding in fonts in a builtin DEFAULT_FONTPATH, or
-       in a path from the GDFONTPATH environment variable.
-     * remove some unused symbols to reduce compiler warnings
-     * bugfix in size comparisons in gdImageCompare
-     * REXX now mentioned
-     * All memory allocation functions are now wrapped within the
-       library; gdFree is exported and recommended for freeing memory
-       returned by the gdImage(Something)Ptr family of functions.
-       
-  What's new in version 1.8.3?
-  
-     * WBMP output memory leak fixed
-     * #include <gd.h> corrected to #include "gd.h" in gd_wbmp.c
-     * Documented the fact that the source and output images shouldn't
-       match in the WBMP test except for black and white source images
-       
-  What's new in version 1.8.2?
-  
-     * WBMP support debugged and improved by Johann Van den Brande
-     * WBMP tests added to gdtest.c by Thomas Boutell
-     * Use of platform-dependent 'install' command removed by Thomas
-       Boutell
-     * Comments added to Makefile warning users to juggle the order of
-       the libraries if the linker complains; is there any portable way
-       to do this automatically, short of using autoconf?
-     * Documentation of gdImageCreateFromXpm corrected
-     * Updated links to fast-moving, always dodging libpng and zlib web
-       sites
-       
-  What's new in version 1.8.1?
-  
-     * Optional components no longer built by default (following the
-       documentation)
-     * JPEG code no longer requires inappropriate header files
-     * Win32 patches from Joe Gregorio
-     * 16-bit font support for bdftogd, from Honza Pazdziora
-       
-  What's new in version 1.8?
-  
-     * Support for JPEG output, courtesy of Doug Becker
-     * A link to Michael Bradbery's Pascal wrapper
-     * Support for WBMP output, courtesy of Maurice Szmurlo
-     * gdImageColorClosestHWB function based on hue, whiteness,
-       blackness, superior to the regular gdImageColorClosest function,
-       courtesy of Philip Warner
-     * License clarification: yes, you can modify gd
-       
-    Additional JPEG Information
-    
-   Support for reading and writing JPEG-format images is courtesy of Doug
-   Becker and the Independent JPEG Group / Thomas G. Lane. You can get
-   the latest version of the IJG JPEG software from
-   ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/ (e.g., the jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz file).
-   You _must_ use version 6b or later of the IJG JPEG software. You might
-   also consult the JPEG FAQ at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.7.3?
-  
-   Another attempt at Makefile fixes to permit linking with all libraries
-   required on platforms with order- dependent linkers. Perhaps it will
-   work this time.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.7.2?
-  
-   An uninitialized-pointer bug in gdtestttf.c was corrected. This bug
-   caused crashes at the end of each call to gdImageStringTTF on some
-   platforms. Thanks to Wolfgang Haefelinger.
-   
-   Documentation fixes. Thanks to Dohn Arms.
-   
-   Makefile fixes to permit linking with all libraries required on
-   platforms with order- dependent linkers.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.7.1?
-  
-   A minor buglet in the Makefile was corrected, as well as an inaccurate
-   error message in gdtestttf.c. Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.7?
-  
-   Version 1.7 contains the following changes:
-     * Japanese language support for the TrueType functions. Thanks to
-       Masahito Yamaga.
-     * autoconf and configure have been removed, in favor of a carefully
-       designed Makefile which produces and properly installs the library
-       and the binaries. System-dependent variables are at the top of the
-       Makefile for easy modification. I'm sorry, folks, but autoconf
-       generated _many, many confused email messages_ from people who
-       didn't have things where autoconf expected to find them. I am not
-       an autoconf/automake wizard, and gd is a simple, very compact
-       library which does not need to be a shared library. I _did_ make
-       many improvements over the old gd 1.3 Makefile, which were
-       directly inspired by the autoconf version found in the 1.6 series
-       (thanks to John Ellson).
-     * Completely ANSI C compliant, according to the -pedantic-errors
-       flag of gcc. Several pieces of not-quite-ANSI-C code were causing
-       problems for those with non-gcc compilers.
-     * gdttf.c patched to allow the use of Windows symbol fonts, when
-       present (thanks to Joseph Peppin).
-     * extern "C" wrappers added to gd.h and the font header files for
-       the convenience of C++ programmers. bdftogd was also modified to
-       automatically insert these wrappers into future font header files.
-       Thanks to John Lindal.
-     * Compiles correctly on platforms that don't define SEEK_SET. Thanks
-       to Robert Bonomi.
-     * Loads Xpm images via the gdImageCreateFromXpm function, if the Xpm
-       library is available. Thanks to Caolan McNamara.
-       
-  What's new in version 1.6.3?
-  
-   Version 1.6.3 corrects a memory leak in gd_png.c. This leak caused a
-   significant amount of memory to be allocated and not freed when
-   writing a PNG image.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.6.2?
-  
-   Version 1.6.2 from John Ellson adds two new functions:
-     * gdImageStringTTF - scalable, rotatable, anti-aliased, TrueType
-       strings using the FreeType library, but only if libttf is found by
-       configure. _We do not provide TrueType fonts. Obtaining them is
-       entirely up to you._
-     * gdImageColorResolve - an efficient alternative for the common code
-       fragment:
-
-
-      if ((color=gdImageColorExact(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
-          if ((color=gdImageColorAllocate(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
-              color=gdImageColorClosest(im,R,G,B);
-
-   Also in this release the build process has been converted to GNU
-   autoconf/automake/libtool conventions so that both (or either) static
-   and shared libraries can be built.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.6.1?
-  
-   Version 1.6.1 incorporates superior PNG reading and writing code from
-   Greg Roelofs, with minor modifications by Tom Boutell. Specifically, I
-   altered his code to read non-palette images (converting them to
-   palette images badly, by dithering them), and to tolerate palette
-   images with types of transparency that gd doesn't actually support (it
-   just ignores the advanced transparency features). Any bugs in this
-   area are therefore my fault, not Greg's.
-   
-   Unlike gd 1.6, users should have no trouble linking with gd 1.6.1 if
-   they follow the instructions and install all of the pieces. However,
-   _If you get undefined symbol errors, be sure to check for older
-   versions of libpng in your library directories!_
-   
-  What's new in version 1.6?
-  
-   Version 1.6 features the following changes:
-   
-   _Support for 8-bit palette PNG images has been added. Support for GIF
-   has been removed._ This step was taken to completely avoid the legal
-   controversy regarding the LZW compression algorithm used in GIF.
-   Unisys holds a patent which is relevant to LZW compression. PNG is a
-   superior image format in any case. Now that PNG is supported by both
-   Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape (in their recent releases),
-   we highly recommend that GD users upgrade in order to get
-   well-compressed images in a format which is legally unemcumbered.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.5?
-  
-   Version 1.5 featured the following changes:
-   
-   _New GD2 format_
-          An improvement over the GD format, the GD2 format uses the zlib
-          compression library to compress the image in chunks. This
-          results in file sizes comparable to GIFs, with the ability to
-          access parts of large images without having to read the entire
-          image into memory.
-          
-          This format also supports version numbers and rudimentary
-          validity checks, so it should be more 'supportable' than the
-          previous GD format.
-          
-   _Re-arranged source files_
-          gd.c has been broken into constituant parts: io, gif, gd, gd2
-          and graphics functions are now in separate files.
-          
-   _Extended I/O capabilities._
-          The source/sink feature has been extended to support GD2 file
-          formats (which require seek/tell functions), and to allow more
-          general non-file I/O.
-          
-   _Better support for Lincoln Stein's Perl Module_
-          The new gdImage*Ptr function returns the chosen format stored
-          in a block of memory. This can be directly used by the GD perl
-          module.
-          
-   _Added functions_
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2Part - allows retrieval of part of an image
-          (good for huge images, like maps),
-          gdImagePaletteCopy - Copies a palette from one image to
-          another, doing it's best to match the colors in the target
-          image to the colors in the source palette.
-          gdImageGd2, gdImageCreateFromGd2 - Support for new format
-          gdImageCopyMerge - Merges two images (useful to highlight part
-          of an image)
-          gdImageCopyMergeGray - Similar to gdImageCopyMerge, but tries
-          to preserve source image hue.
-          gdImagePngPtr, gdImageJpegPtr, gdImageWBMPPtr, gdImageGdPtr,
-          gdImageGd2Ptr - return memory blocks for each type of image.
-          gdImageCreateFromPngCtx, gdImageCreateFromGdCtx,
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx, gdImageCreateFromGd2PartCtx - Support
-          for new I/O context.
-          
-   _NOTE:_ In fairness to Thomas Boutell, any bug/problems with any of
-   the above features should probably be reported to Philip Warner.
-   
-  What's new in version 1.4?
-  
-   Version 1.4 features the following changes:
-   
-   Fixed polygon fill routine (again)
-          Thanks to Kirsten Schulz, version 1.4 is able to fill numerous
-          types of polygons that caused problems with previous releases,
-          including version 1.3.
-          
-   Support for alternate data sources
-          Programmers who wish to load a GIF from something other than a
-          stdio FILE * stream can use the new gdImageCreateFromPngSource
-          function.
-          
-   Support for alternate data destinations
-          Programmers who wish to write a GIF to something other than a
-          stdio FILE * stream can use the new gdImagePngToSink function.
-          
-   More tolerant when reading GIFs
-          Version 1.4 does not crash when reading certain animated GIFs,
-          although it still only reads the first frame. Version 1.4 also
-          has overflow testing code to prevent crashes when reading
-          damaged GIFs.
-          
-  What's new in version 1.3?
-  
-   Version 1.3 features the following changes:
-   
-   Non-LZW-based GIF compression code
-          Version 1.3 contained GIF compression code that uses simple Run
-          Length Encoding instead of LZW compression, while still
-          retaining compatibility with normal LZW-based GIF decoders
-          (your browser will still like your GIFs). _LZW compression is
-          patented by Unisys. We are currently reevaluating the approach
-          taken by gd 1.3. The current release of gd does not support
-          this approach. We recommend that you use the current release,
-          and generate PNG images._ Thanks to Hutchison Avenue Software
-          Corporation for contributing the RLE GIF code.
-          
-   8-bit fonts, and 8-bit font support
-          This improves support for European languages. Thanks are due to
-          Honza Pazdziora and also to Jan Pazdziora . Also see the
-          provided bdftogd Perl script if you wish to convert fixed-width
-          X11 fonts to gd fonts.
-          
-   16-bit font support (no fonts provided)
-          Although no such fonts are provided in the distribution, fonts
-          containing more than 256 characters should work if the
-          gdImageString16 and gdImageStringUp16 routines are used.
-          
-   Improvements to the "webpng" example/utility
-          The "webpng" utility is now a slightly more useful application.
-          Thanks to Brian Dowling for this code.
-          
-   Corrections to the color resolution field of GIF output
-          Thanks to Bruno Aureli.
-          
-   Fixed polygon fills
-          A one-line patch for the infamous polygon fill bug, courtesy of
-          Jim Mason. I believe this fix is sufficient. However, if you
-          find a situation where polygon fills still fail to behave
-          properly, please send code that demonstrates the problem, _and_
-          a fix if you have one. Verifying the fix is important.
-          
-   Row-major, not column-major
-          Internally, gd now represents the array of pixels as an array
-          of rows of pixels, rather than an array of columns of pixels.
-          This improves the performance of compression and decompression
-          routines slightly, because horizontally adjacent pixels are now
-          next to each other in memory. _This should not affect properly
-          written gd applications, but applications that directly
-          manipulate the pixels array will require changes._
-          
-  What else do I need to use gd?
-  
-   To use gd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. _All popular Windows 95
-   and NT C compilers are ANSI C compliant._ Any full-ANSI-standard C
-   compiler should be adequate. _The cc compiler released with SunOS
-   4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler. Most Unix users who do not already
-   have gcc should get it. gcc is free, ANSI compliant and a de facto
-   industry standard. Ask your ISP why it is missing._
-   
-   As of version 1.6, you also need the zlib compression library, and the
-   libpng library. As of version 1.6.2, you can draw text using
-   antialiased TrueType fonts if you also have the libttf library
-   installed, but this is not mandatory. zlib is available for a variety
-   of platforms from the zlib web site. libpng is available for a variety
-   of platforms from the PNG web site.
-   
-   You will also want a PNG viewer, if you do not already have one for
-   your system, since you will need a good way to check the results of
-   your work. Netscape 4.04 and higher, and Microsoft Internet Explorer
-   4.0 or higher, both support PNG. For some purposes you might be
-   happier with a package like Lview Pro for Windows or xv for X. There
-   are PNG viewers available for every graphics-capable modern operating
-   system, so consult newsgroups relevant to your particular system.
-   
-  How do I get gd?
-  
-    By HTTP
-    
-     * Gzipped Tar File (Unix)
-     * .ZIP File (Windows)
-       
-    By FTP
-    
-     * Gzipped Tar File (Unix)
-     * .ZIP File (Windows)
-       
-  How do I build gd?
-  
-   In order to build gd, you must first unpack the archive you have
-   downloaded. If you are not familiar with tar and gunzip (Unix) or ZIP
-   (Windows), please consult with an experienced user of your system.
-   Sorry, we cannot answer questions about basic Internet skills.
-   
-   Unpacking the archive will produce a directory called "gd-1.8.4".
-   
-    For Unix
-    
-   cd to the 1.8.4 directory. Edit the Makefile with your preferred text
-   editor and make any necessary changes to the settings at the top,
-   especially if you want Xpm or TrueType support. Next, type "make". If
-   you are the system administrator, and you wish to make the gd library
-   available to other programs, you may also wish to type "make install".
-   
-   If you get errors, edit the Makefile again, paying special attention
-   to the INCLUDEDIRS and LIBDIRS settings.
-   
-   IF YOU GET LINKER ERRORS, TRY JUGGLING THE ORDER OF THE -l DIRECTIVES
-   IN THE MAKEFILE. Some platforms may prefer that the libraries be
-   listed in the opposite order.
-   
-    For Windows, Mac, Et Cetera
-    
-   Create a project using your favorite programming environment. Copy all
-   of the gd files to the project directory. Add gd.c to your project.
-   Add other source files as appropriate. Learning the basic skills of
-   creating projects with your chosen C environment is up to you.
-   
-   You have now built both the gd library and a demonstration program
-   which shows off the capabilities of gd. To see it in action, type
-   "gddemo".
-   
-   gddemo should execute without incident, creating the file demoout.png.
-   (Note there is also a file named demoin.png, which is provided in the
-   package as part of the demonstration.)
-   
-   Display demoout.png in your PNG viewer. The image should be 128x128
-   pixels and should contain an image of the space shuttle with quite a
-   lot of graphical elements drawn on top of it.
-   
-   (If you are missing the demoin.png file, the other items should appear
-   anyway.)
-   
-   Look at demoin.png to see the original space shuttle image which was
-   scaled and copied into the output image.
-   
-  gd basics: using gd in your program
-  
-   gd lets you create PNG or JPEG images on the fly. To use gd in your
-   program, include the file gd.h, and link with the libgd.a library
-   produced by "make libgd.a", under Unix. Under other operating systems
-   you will add gd.c to your own project.
-   
-   If you want to use the provided fonts, include gdfontt.h, gdfonts.h,
-   gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. For more impressive results,
-   install FreeType 2.x and use the new gdImageStringFT function. If you
-   are not using the provided Makefile and/or a library-based approach,
-   be sure to include the source modules as well in your project. (They
-   may be too large for 16-bit memory models, that is, 16-bit DOS and
-   Windows.)
-   
-   Here is a short example program. _(For a more advanced example, see
-   gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same
-   program; it demonstrates additional features!)_
-   
-/* Bring in gd library functions */

-   When executed, this program creates an image, allocates two colors
-   (the first color allocated becomes the background color), draws a
-   diagonal line (note that 0, 0 is the upper left corner), writes the
-   image to PNG and JPEG files, and destroys the image.
-   
-   The above example program should give you an idea of how the package
-   works. gd provides many additional functions, which are listed in the
-   following reference chapters, complete with code snippets
-   demonstrating each. There is also an alphabetical index.
-   
-  Webpng: a more powerful gd example
-  
-   Webpng is a simple utility program to manipulate PNGs from the command
-   line. It is written for Unix and similar command-line systems, but
-   should be easily adapted for other environments. Webpng allows you to
-   set transparency and interlacing and output interesting information
-   about the PNG in question.
-   
-   webpng.c is provided in the distribution. Unix users can simply type
-   "make webpng" to compile the program. Type "webpng" with no arguments
-   to see the available options.

-  
-   gdImage_(TYPE)_
-          The data structure in which gd stores images. gdImageCreate
-          returns a pointer to this type, and the other functions expect
-          to receive a pointer to this type as their first argument. You
-          may read the members sx (size on X axis), sy (size on Y axis),
-          colorsTotal (total colors), red (red component of colors; an
-          array of 256 integers between 0 and 255), green (green
-          component of colors, as above), blue (blue component of colors,
-          as above), and transparent (index of transparent color, -1 if
-          none); please do so using the macros provided. Do NOT set the
-          members directly from your code; use the functions provided.
-          
-
-typedef struct {
-        unsigned char ** pixels;
-        int sx;
-        int sy;

-        int blue[gdMaxColors];
-        int open[gdMaxColors];
-        int transparent;
-} gdImage;
-
-   gdImagePtr _(TYPE)_
-          A pointer to an image structure. gdImageCreate returns this
-          type, and the other functions expect it as the first argument.
-          
-   gdFont _(TYPE)_
-          A font structure. Used to declare the characteristics of a
-          font. Plese see the files gdfontl.c and gdfontl.h for an
-          example of the proper declaration of this structure. You can
-          provide your own font data by providing such a structure and
-          the associated pixel array. You can determine the width and
-          height of a single character in a font by examining the w and h
-          members of the structure. If you will not be creating your own
-          fonts, you will not need to concern yourself with the rest of
-          the components of this structure.
-          
-
-typedef struct {
-        /* # of characters in font */
-        int nchars;
-        /* First character is numbered... (usually 32 = space) */
-        int offset;
-        /* Character width and height */
-        int w;
-        int h;
-        /* Font data; array of characters, one row after another.
-                Easily included in code, also easily loaded from
-                data files. */
-        char *data;
-} gdFont;
-
-   gdFontPtr _(TYPE)_
-          A pointer to a font structure. Text-output functions expect
-          these as their second argument, following the gdImagePtr
-          argument. Two such pointers are declared in the provided
-          include files gdfonts.h and gdfontl.h.
-          
-   gdPoint _(TYPE)_
-          Represents a point in the coordinate space of the image; used
-          by gdImagePolygon and gdImageFilledPolygon.
-          
-
-typedef struct {
-        int x, y;
-} gdPoint, *gdPointPtr;
-
-   gdPointPtr _(TYPE)_
-          A pointer to a gdPoint structure; passed as an argument to
-          gdImagePolygon and gdImageFilledPolygon.
-          
-   gdSource _(TYPE)_
-
-typedef struct {
-        int (*source) (void *context, char *buffer, int len);
-        void *context;
-} gdSource, *gdSourcePtr;
-
-   Represents a source from which a PNG can be read. Programmers who do
-   not wish to read PNGs from a file can provide their own alternate
-   input mechanism, using the gdImageCreateFromPngSource function. See
-   the documentation of that function for an example of the proper use of
-   this type.
-   
-   gdSink _(TYPE)_
-
-typedef struct {
-        int (*sink) (void *context, char *buffer, int len);
-        void *context;
-} gdSink, *gdSinkPtr;
-
-   Represents a "sink" (destination) to which a PNG can be written.
-   Programmers who do not wish to write PNGs to a file can provide their
-   own alternate output mechanism, using the gdImagePngToSink function.
-   See the documentation of that function for an example of the proper
-   use of this type.

-   gdImageCreate(sx, sy) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageCreate is called to create images. Invoke gdImageCreate
-          with the x and y dimensions of the desired image. gdImageCreate
-          returns a gdImagePtr to the new image, or NULL if unable to
-          allocate the image. The image must eventually be destroyed
-          using gdImageDestroy().

-          gdImageCreateFromJpegCtx(FILE *in) _(FUNCTION)_
-          
-          
-          gdImageCreateFromJpeg is called to load images from JPEG format
-          files. Invoke gdImageCreateFromJpeg with an already opened
-          pointer to a file containing the desired image.
-          gdImageCreateFromJpeg returns a gdImagePtr to the new image, or
-          NULL if unable to load the image (most often because the file
-          is corrupt or does not contain a JPEG image).
-          gdImageCreateFromPng does _not_ close the file. You can inspect
-          the sx and sy members of the image to determine its size. The

-          
-          
-          gdImageCreateFromPng is called to load images from PNG format
-          files. Invoke gdImageCreateFromPng with an already opened

-
-   gdImageCreateFromPngSource(gdSourcePtr in) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageCreateFromPngSource is called to load a PNG from a data
-          source other than a file. Usage is very similar to the
-          gdImageCreateFromPng function, except that the programmer
-          provides a custom data source.
-          
-          The programmer must write an input function which accepts a
-          context pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be read as
-          arguments. This function must read the number of bytes
-          requested, unless the end of the file has been reached, in
-          which case the function should return zero, or an error has
-          occurred, in which case the function should return -1. The
-          programmer then creates a gdSource structure and sets the
-          source pointer to the input function and the context pointer to
-          any value which is useful to the programmer.
-          
-          The example below implements gdImageCreateFromPng by creating a
-          custom data source and invoking gdImageCreateFromPngSource.
-          
-
-static int freadWrapper(void *context, char *buf, int len);
-
-gdImagePtr gdImageCreateFromPng(FILE *in)
-{
-        gdSource s;
-        s.source = freadWrapper;
-        s.context = in;
-        return gdImageCreateFromPngSource(&s);
-}
-
-static int freadWrapper(void *context, char *buf, int len)
-{
-        int got = fread(buf, 1, len, (FILE *) context);
-        return got;
-}
-
-   gdImageCreateFromGd(FILE *in) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageCreateFromGdCtx(gdIOCtx *in) _(FUNCTION)_
-          
-          
-          gdImageCreateFromGd is called to load images from gd format
-          files. Invoke gdImageCreateFromGd with an already opened
-          pointer to a file containing the desired image in the gd file
-          format, which is specific to gd and intended for very fast
-          loading. (It is _not_ intended for compression; for
-          compression, use PNG or JPEG.) gdImageCreateFromGd returns a
-          gdImagePtr to the new image, or NULL if unable to load the
-          image (most often because the file is corrupt or does not
-          contain a gd format image). gdImageCreateFromGd does _not_
-          close the file. You can inspect the sx and sy members of the
-          image to determine its size. The image must eventually be
-          destroyed using gdImageDestroy().

-          
-          
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2 is called to load images from gd2 format
-          files. Invoke gdImageCreateFromGd2 with an already opened
-          pointer to a file containing the desired image in the gd2 file
-          format, which is specific to gd2 and intended for fast loading
-          of parts of large images. (It is a compressed format, but
-          generally not as good a LZW compression). gdImageCreateFromGd
-          returns a gdImagePtr to the new image, or NULL if unable to
-          load the image (most often because the file is corrupt or does
-          not contain a gd format image). gdImageCreateFromGd2 does _not_

-          
-          
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2Part is called to load parts of images from
-          gd2 format files. Invoked in the same way as
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2, but with extra parameters indicating the
-          source (x, y) and width/height of the desired image.
-          gdImageCreateFromGd2Part returns a gdImagePtr to the new image,

-          be destroyed using gdImageDestroy().
-          
-   gdImageCreateFromXbm(FILE *in) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageCreateFromXbm is called to load images from X bitmap
-          format files. Invoke gdImageCreateFromXbm with an already
-          opened pointer to a file containing the desired image.
-          gdImageCreateFromXbm returns a gdImagePtr to the new image, or
-          NULL if unable to load the image (most often because the file
-          is corrupt or does not contain an X bitmap format image).
-          gdImageCreateFromXbm does _not_ close the file. You can inspect
-          the sx and sy members of the image to determine its size. The

-
-   gdImageCreateFromXpm(char *filename) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageCreateFromXbm is called to load images from XPM X Window
-          System color bitmap format files. This function is available
-          only if HAVE_XPM is selected in the Makefile and the Xpm
-          library is linked with the application. Unlike most gd file
-          functions, the Xpm functions require filenames, not file
-          pointers. gdImageCreateFromXpm returns a gdImagePtr to the new
-          image, or NULL if unable to load the image (most often because
-          the file is corrupt or does not contain an XPM bitmap format
-          image). You can inspect the sx and sy members of the image to

-
-   gdImageDestroy(gdImagePtr im) _(FUNCTION)_
-          gdImageDestroy is used to free the memory associated with an
-          image. It is important to invoke gdImageDestroy before exiting
-          your program or assigning a new image to a gdImagePtr variable.

-          void gdImageJpegCtx(gdImagePtr im, gdIOCtx *out, int quality)
-          
-   _(FUNCTION)_
-   
-   gdImageJpeg outputs the specified image to the specified file in JPEG
-   format. The file must be open for writing. Under MSDOS and all
-   versions of Windows, it is important to use "wb" as opposed to simply
-   "w" as the mode when opening the file, and under Unix there is no
-   penalty for doing so. gdImageJpeg does _not_ close the file; your code
-   must do so.
-   
-   If quality is negative, the default IJG JPEG quality value (which
-   should yield a good general quality / size tradeoff for most
-   situations) is used. Otherwise, for practical purposes, quality should
-   be a value in the range 0-95, higher quality values usually implying
-   both higher quality and larger image sizes.
-   
-   If you have set image interlacing using gdImageInterlace, this
-   function will interpret that to mean you wish to output a progressive
-   JPEG. Some programs (e.g., Web browsers) can display progressive JPEGs
-   incrementally; this can be useful when browsing over a relatively slow
-   communications link, for example. Progressive JPEGs can also be
-   slightly smaller than sequential (non-progressive) JPEGs.

-   gdImagePng function, except that the programmer provides a custom data
-   sink.
-   
-   The programmer must write an output function which accepts a context
-   pointer, a buffer, and a number of bytes to be written as arguments.
-   This function must write the number of bytes requested and return that
-   number, unless an error has occurred, in which case the function
-   should return -1. The programmer then creates a gdSink structure and
-   sets the sink pointer to the output function and the context pointer

-   must do so.
-   
-   _WBMP file support is black and white only. The color index specified

-   void* gdImageWBMPPtr(gdImagePtr im, int *size) _(FUNCTION)_
-   Identical to gdImageWBMP except that it returns a pointer to a memory

-   it is no longer needed. _The caller must invoke gdFree(), not free(),
-   unless the caller is absolutely certain that the same implementations
-   of malloc, free, etc. are used both at library build time and at

-   no penalty for doing so. gdImageGd2 does _not_ close the file; your
-   code must do so.
-   
-   The gd2 image format is intended for fast reads and writes of parts of
-   images. It is a compressed format, and well suited to retrieving smll
-   sections of much larger images. The third and fourth parameters are
-   the 'chunk size' and format resposectively.
-   
-   The file is stored as a series of compressed subimages, and the _Chunk
-   Size_ determines the sub-image size - a value of zero causes the GD
-   library to use the default.
-   
-   It is also possible to store GD2 files in an uncompressed format, in
-   which case the fourth parameter should be GD2_FMT_RAW.

-          A "brush" is an image used to draw wide, shaped strokes in

-          brush image need not be a single pixel. _Any_ gd image can be
-          used as a brush, and by setting the transparent color index of
-          the brush image with gdImageColorTransparent, a brush of any
-          shape can be created. All line-drawing functions, such as
-          gdImageLine and gdImagePolygon, will use the current brush if
-          the special "color" gdBrushed or gdStyledBrushed is used when
-          calling them.
-          
-          gdImageSetBrush is used to specify the brush to be used in a
-          particular image. You can set any image to be the brush. If the
-          brush image does not have the same color map as the first
-          image, any colors missing from the first image will be
-          allocated. If not enough colors can be allocated, the closest
-          colors already available will be used. This allows arbitrary
-          PNGs to be used as brush images. It also means, however, that
-          you should not set a brush unless you will actually use it; if
-          you set a rapid succession of different brush images, you can
-          quickly fill your color map, and the results will not be
-          optimal.
-          
-          You need not take any special action when you are finished with
-          a brush. As for any other image, if you will not be using the
-          brush image for any further purpose, you should call
-          gdImageDestroy. You must not use the color gdBrushed if the

-          gdImageFilledPolygon, will use the current tile if the special
-          "color" gdTiled is used when calling them.
-          
-          gdImageSetTile is used to specify the tile to be used in a
-          particular image. You can set any image to be the tile. If the
-          tile image does not have the same color map as the first image,
-          any colors missing from the first image will be allocated. If
-          not enough colors can be allocated, the closest colors already
-          available will be used. This allows arbitrary PNGs to be used
-          as tile images. It also means, however, that you should not set
-          a tile unless you will actually use it; if you set a rapid
-          succession of different tile images, you can quickly fill your
-          color map, and the results will not be optimal.
-          
-          You need not take any special action when you are finished with
-          a tile. As for any other image, if you will not be using the
-          tile image for any further purpose, you should call
-          gdImageDestroy. You must not use the color gdTiled if the
-          current tile has been destroyed; you can of course set a new
-          tile to replace it.

-   void gdImageSetStyle(gdImagePtr im, int *style, int styleLength)
-          _(FUNCTION)_
-          It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and
-          other variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used
-          to set any desired series of colors, including a special color
-          that leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the
-          drawing of a line.
-          
-          To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign
-          them the desired series of color values to be repeated. You can
-          assign the special color value gdTransparent to indicate that
-          the existing color should be left unchanged for that particular
-          pixel (allowing a dashed line to be attractively drawn over an
-          existing image).
-          
-          Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal
-          gdImageLine function with the special color value gdStyled.
-          
-          As of version 1.1.1, the style array is copied when you set the
-          style, so you need not be concerned with keeping the array
-          around indefinitely. This should not break existing code that
-          assumes styles are not copied.
-          
-          You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush image
-          at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke. When creating a
-          style for use with a brush, the style values are interpreted
-          differently: zero (0) indicates pixels at which the brush
-          should not be drawn, while one (1) indicates pixels at which
-          the brush should be drawn. To draw a styled, brushed line, you
-          must use the special color value gdStyledBrushed. For an
-          example of this feature in use, see gddemo.c (provided in the
-          distribution).

-                on the image using the FreeType library to render
-                user-supplied TrueType fonts. _We do not provide TrueType
-                fonts (.ttf and .ttc files). Obtaining them is entirely
-                up to you._ The string is anti-aliased, meaning that
-                there should be fewer "jaggies" visible. The fontname is
-                the full pathname to a TrueType font file, or a font face
-                name if the GDFONTPATH environment variable or FreeType's
-                DEFAULT_FONTPATH variable have been set intelligently.
-                The string may be arbitrarily scaled (ptsize) and rotated
-                (angle in radians).
-                
-                The user-supplied int brect[8] array is filled on return
-                from gdImageStringFT with the 8 elements representing the
-                4 corner coordinates of the bounding rectangle.
-                0 lower left corner, X position
-                lower left corner, Y position

-                7 upper left corner, Y position
-                
-                The points are relative to the text regardless of the
-                angle, so "upper left" means in the top left-hand corner
-                seeing the text horizontally.
-                
-                Use a NULL gdImagePtr to get the bounding rectangle
-                without rendering. This is a relatively cheap operation
-                if followed by a rendering of the same string, because of
-                the caching of the partial rendering during bounding
-                rectangle calculation.
-                
-                The string is rendered in the color indicated by the gf
-                color index. _Use the negative of the desired color index
-                to disable anti-aliasing._
-                
-                The string may contain UTF-8 sequences like: "&#192;"
-                
-                gdImageStringFT will return a null char* on success, or
-                an error string on failure.

-                gdImageColorAllocate finds the first available color
-                index in the image specified, sets its RGB values to
-                those requested (255 is the maximum for each), and
-                returns the index of the new color table entry. When

-                function, you are setting the background color for that
-                image.
-                
-                In the event that all gdMaxColors colors (256) have

-                -1 to indicate failure. (This is not uncommon when
-                working with existing PNG files that already use 256
-                colors.) Note that gdImageColorAllocate does not check
-                for existing colors that match your request; see

-                
-                When you copy a region from one location in an image to

-                      default, images are not interlaced. (When writing

-                            gdImageColorTransparent for that mechanism.)

-                    gdStyledBrushed _(CONSTANT)_
-                            Used in place of a color when invoking a
-                            line-drawing function such as gdImageLine or
-                            gdImageRectangle. When gdStyledBrushed is
-                            used as the color, the brush image set with
-                            gdImageSetBrush is drawn at each pixel of the
-                            line, providing that the style set with
-                            gdImageSetStyle contains a nonzero value (OR
-                            gdTransparent, which does not equal zero but
-                            is supported for consistency) for the current
-                            pixel. (Pixels are drawn successively from
-                            the style as the line is drawn, returning to
-                            the beginning when the available pixels in
-                            the style are exhausted.) Note that this
-                            differs from the behavior of gdStyled, in
-                            which the values in the style are used as
-                            actual pixel colors, except for
-                            gdTransparent.

-                            with programs that use gdImageDashedLine. New
-                            programs should use gdImageSetStyle and call
-                            the standard gdImageLine function with the
-                            special "color" gdStyled or gdStyledBrushed.

-                            gdImageFilledRectangle, gdImageFilledPolygon,
-                            gdImageFill, and gdImageFillToBorder. gdTiled
-                            selects a pixel from the tile image set with
-                            gdImageSetTile in such a way as to ensure
-                            that the filled area will be tiled with
-                            copies of the tile image. See the discussions
-                            of gdImageFill and gdImageFillToBorder for
-                            special restrictions regarding those

-                    gdTransparent _(CONSTANT)_
-                            Used in place of a normal color in a style to
-                            be set with gdImageSetStyle. gdTransparent is
-                            _not_ the transparent color index of the
-                            image; for that functionality please see

-  About the gdIOCtx structure
-  
-                            Version 1.5 of GD added a new style of I/O
-                            based on an IOCtx structure (the most
-                            up-to-date version can be found in gd_io.h):
-                            
-
-typedef struct gdIOCtx {
-        int     (*getC)(struct gdIOCtx*);
-        int     (*getBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, void*, int);
-
-        void     (*putC)(struct gdIOCtx*, int);
-        int     (*putBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, const void*, int);
-
-        int     (*seek)(struct gdIOCtx*, const int);
-        long    (*tell)(struct gdIOCtx*);

-        void    (*free)(struct gdIOCtx*);

-} gdIOCtx;
-
-                    Most functions that accepted files in previous
-                            versions now also have a counterpart that
-                            accepts an I/O context. These functions have
-                            a 'Ctx' suffix.
-                            
-                            The Ctx routines use the function pointers in
-                            the I/O context pointed to by gdIOCtx to
-                            perform all I/O. Examples of how to implement
-                            an I/O context can be found in io_file.c
-                            (which provides a wrapper for file routines),
-                            and io_dp.c (which implements in-memory
-                            storage).
-                            
-                            It is not necessary to implement all
-                            functions in an I/O context if you know that
-                            it will only be used in limited
-                            cirsumstances. At the time of writing
-                            (Version 1.6.1, July 1999), the known
-                            requirements are:
-                            
-                            All   Must have 'free',
-                            Anything that reads from the context Must
-                            have 'getC' and 'getBuf',
-                            Anything that writes to the context Must have
-                            'putC' and 'putBuf'.
-                            If gdCreateFromGd2Part is called Must also
-                            have 'seek' and 'tell'.
-                            If gdImageGd2 is called Must also have 'seek'
-                            and 'tell'.
