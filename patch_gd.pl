+--------------------------
+
+Broke gd.c into multiple files; gd.c now has graphics operations, and gd_<zzz> has specific
+support for different formats (eg. GD, GD2, GIF).
+
+Restructured I/O so that reading from files/streams/anything is now possible. All handled
+through the IOCtx record which must define some basic I/O services. All services are defined
+for files, but only some are defined for in-memory pointers. The in-memory pointer 
+implementation is primarily for Perl compatibility. Changed basically involved writing some 
+low level IO routines, and relpacing most FILE* variables with IOCtx*.
+
+Added gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr, gdImageGifPtr, gdImageLzwPtr for Perl compatibility.
+
+Broke up the GIF handling routines; gd_gif_in.c does all GIF input (this did not change when
+support for LZW compression was removed). gd_gif_out.c not handles the miGif compression that
+was introduced in version 1.3
+
+Reinstated LZW support through the gdImageLzw function (defined in gd_lzw_out.c). 
+This is NOT built by default, and the header file must be modified to include it in the build.
+
+Added 'GD2' support. This is a zlib-compressed internal format useful for extracting portions
+of images without having to read entire image files. Informal tests suggest it is only 30% slower
+than the old GD format, and file space requirements are similar to GOF. The GD2 header fields 
+now contain version information, so the format can probably be considered stable across versions.
+
+Various other functions also added (see index.html).

+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
+`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
+reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
+(useful mainly for debugging `configure').
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
+contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
+called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
+it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
+
+The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
+     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
+     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
+     `configure' itself.
+
+     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
+     messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.
+
+  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   This package has three optional features which can be enabled at
+configure time:
+
+   ./configure --enable-jpeg           Enable JPEG support
+   ./configure --enable-freetype       Enable TrueType fonts
+   ./configure --enable-xpm            Enable reading of XPM files
+
+   You may combine these three features if you wish.
+
+JPEG and FreeType are only available if you have downloaded and
+installed the corresponding libraries.  Xpm is only available if you
+have the XPM library installed and have a full X11 installation.  If
+you try to install a feature, and don't have the appropriate library,
+you will receive a warning to that effect.
+
+Read README for information on obtaining these libraries.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
+initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
+a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
+this:
+     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
+
+Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
+     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
+supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
+
+   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
+variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
+in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
+one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
+architecture.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
+`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
+installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
+option `--prefix=PATH'.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
+PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
+will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
+`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the host type.
+
+   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
+use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
+produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
+system on which you are compiling the package.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Operation Controls
+==================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
+     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
+     debugging `configure'.
+
+`--help'
+     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--version'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

+990701 Philip Warner (pjw) as documented by TBB
+
+Implemented gdImageSink (missing in initial 1.5 release),

+--------------------------
+
+Broke gd.c into multiple files; gd.c now has graphics operations, and gd_<zzz> has specific
+support for different formats (eg. GD, GD2, GIF).
+
+Restructured I/O so that reading from files/streams/anything is now possible. All handled
+through the IOCtx record which must define some basic I/O services. All services are defined
+for files, but only some are defined for in-memory pointers. The in-memory pointer 
+implementation is primarily for Perl compatibility. Changed basically involved writing some 
+low level IO routines, and relpacing most FILE* variables with IOCtx*.
+
+Added gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr, gdImageGifPtr, gdImageLzwPtr for Perl compatibility.
+
+Broke up the GIF handling routines; gd_gif_in.c does all GIF input (this did not change when
+support for LZW compression was removed). gd_gif_out.c not handles the miGif compression that
+was introduced in version 1.3
+
+Reinstated LZW support through the gdImageLzw function (defined in gd_lzw_out.c). 
+This is NOT built by default, and the header file must be modified to include it in the build.
+
+Added 'GD2' support. This is a zlib-compressed internal format useful for extracting portions
+of images without having to read entire image files. Informal tests suggest it is only 30% slower
+than the old GD format, and file space requirements are similar to GOF. The GD2 header fields 
+now contain version information, so the format can probably be considered stable across versions.
+
+Various other functions also added (see index.html).

+GD 2.0.1_patch
+
+This is a patched version of Tom Boutell's GD library version 1.8.4.
+It uses the GNU Autoconfig system to make it easier to compile libgd
+as a shared library, as well as to locate the correct link libraries.
+Compiling libgd as a shared library will make it easier to run the
+Perl GD interface in some cases.

+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
