But the function returns undef, as the first four bytes of the JPEG image on disk does not match the pattern in the _image_type function: The fourth byte is \\376.\nIf I create the GD image using newFromJpeg, it works fine.\nDo you know if there are any issues related to this?\nI see that the magic function detection was changed in v2.42. Unfortunately, I am not aware of the various patterns which can occur as the first four bytes in JPEG files.\nBy the way, we are using GD::Image for sizing images in various formats.\n\nKind regards,\nGeir Myklebust","files":null}]}
