2.25    Fixed Makefile.PL so that GD::Polyline and GD::Simple are installed (thanks to Guy Albertelli).
	
2.24	Fixed gif/anim gif support so that you can't have animated gif support without

		top of autogenerated GD.pm
	Rewrote tests 11 and 12 - if they continue to randomly fail on various
		platforms, they will be removed.
2.22	Changed the way the gd and gd2 round-trip tests are evaluated. This

2.00    Folded in support for gd version 2.0 from Dan Palermo
	Folded in support for splines (GD::Polyline) from Dan Harasty.
